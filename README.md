## 💡 Why OnPay?

Traditional crypto wallets rely on long hexadecimal addresses like:

`0x8cD9F1e0b7A12345aBcDe98765e123456789abcd`


That’s hard to remember, easy to mistype, and not at all beginner-friendly.

**OnPay fixes this.**  
With our ENS-powered naming system, users can register unique usernames like:


`@jenny.idrx` `@markus.idrx` `@shop123.idrx`

This creates a payment experience that feels familiar — like sending money on your favorite messaging app — but fully decentralized.
